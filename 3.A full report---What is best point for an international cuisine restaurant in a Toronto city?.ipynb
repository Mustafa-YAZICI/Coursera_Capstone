    "\n",
    "The population of Toronto is increasing. New restaurants are needed in this city. There are also different restaurants, which include different cuisine in Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it is not possible to access all kinds of data. Even if it is reached, it may take years to make sense of them with today's technology. therefore, it is necessary to collect the important data and make realistic assumptions when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Restaurant customers are located around the available restaurants. And it is appropriate to specify these clients in the make_blobs method with cluster_std = 0.003.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since it covers the world cuisines, it aspires to the customers of every available  restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since the company wanted to open a place in the center, the information of the restaurants close to the center was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is accepted that every restaurant has registered to the site where the data is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the restaurant is a world brand, it covers the world food and is a competitive company, it will increase the probability of success, rather than escaping from the center. Therefore, I need to find where the customer cluster is most concentrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is :If the client want to open an international luxury cuisine restaurant in Toronto city, which point is the best option to open the restaurant?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right location for a business is one of the first and very important decisions in running a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report can help those who are planning to start a new business such as an international luxury cuisine restaurant in Toronto city and need to find the best location for their shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A world brand restaurant chain, which can better understand people's new wishes, is innovative, contains many world cuisines and can attract customers from existing restaurants, will want to make a place in Toronto. And they will want to know where the most suitable place is for this place. The customer will look for a location with the highest potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company concerned is a company that wants to appeal to a large group of customers in the center, not to a small group of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Data Acquisition And Cleaning \n",
    "\n",
    "I will extract the name of the neighborhoods of Toronto from the following link in Wikipedia:\n",
    "'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will help to eliminate bad choice areas for sellecting the most appropriate restaurant for client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I will use Foursquare API to get the information about the restaurants.The informations get extracted from the following link:\n",
    "'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(\n",
    "            \n",
    "In accordance with the acceptance_1 using the restaurant coordinates, I will find the places where the customers are most intense. I will use cluster_std = 0.004 in the make_blobs method to find them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will find the most suitable region with the K-means-clustering method by using the places where the customers are the most crowded. I will find k in the K-means-clustering method that I will use here with estimate_bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will apply the K-Means Clustering method again in this region and find the center of this place. so I will find the best location of the best region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "Modelling : To help clients(who want to open an international luxury cuisine restaurant in a Toronto city ) find best point for opening an international luxury cuisine restaurant in a Toronto city. We will be clustering resourant customers using K - means clustering which is a form of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters data based on predefined cluster size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From the result of first clustering algorithm, it was determined 5 centers were the best choise for opening an international luxury cuisine restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the graphics, we are sure that it is more convenient to open the restaurant in the center of Toronto. Since our company will create a place in the center, so I eliminated it in small and remote places. And I selected the best area according to the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the result of second clustering algorithm, it was determined 1 centers were the best choise for opening an international luxury cuisine restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice to the customer is to determine the places that are suitable to open a restaurant near the point I found, and then choose the most suitable place for these points by calculating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, customer experience should be used and acceptance should be made more accurately, so that the correct result can be approached more.(unfortunately, I could not benefit from the customer experience in this project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of restaurants that are available in the area and not registered with foursquare will increase the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also showed the types of restaurants in the area. Finding successful cooks especially in these types will increase the success of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a new international luxury cuisine restaurant is a complex task that can lead to a large monetary loss if not done properly. Thus, extensive research about the area would greatly get bigger  the likelihood of the restourant succeding. From the project above, I revealed the workflow neccessary for the client to determine what area the restourant should open.for specially, I determined that the optimal location to open an international luxury cuisine restaurant in Toronto shoul be that (k_means3.cluster_centers_) point.\n",
